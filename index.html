  <!-- ABOUT ME -->
  <section id="about" class="section container">
    <h2>👨‍💻 About Me</h2>
    <p>
     I’m passionate and detail-oriented Software Quality Assurance professional with a strong foundation in Computer Science. I began my industry journey as an SQA Intern at QA Harbor Limited, 
      where I was actively involved in software testing, QA audits, and bug tracking for web and mobile applications. Currently, I’m working as a Jr. 
      Software Quality Assurance Engineer at Join Venture AI (a sister concern of Betopia Group), where I contribute to manual testing, test case design, UI/UX evaluations, 
      and effective bug reporting with clear documentation and screenshots. I have proven skills in manual and automated testing, API testing, and load testing, ensuring the delivery of high-quality software products.
    </p>
    <p>
Beyond industry experience, I am a Research Enthusiast in Computer Science and Engineering. My research focuses on Carbon-Neutral Edge Computing, 
      Machine Learning Task Offloading, and Green Energy-Aware Resource Allocation, combining academic rigor with practical applications to optimize computing systems sustainably.
    </p>
    <p>Outside of professional and research pursuits, I was highly engaged in co-curricular activities at Green University of Bangladesh, serving as the Chair of the IEEE Computer Society Student Branch Chapter GUB.
      I also worked as a Student Mentor under the Department of CSE and the GUB Mentorship Program for several semesters. These roles helped me develop leadership, teamwork, and 
      communication skills while organizing national tech carnivals, coding contests, and academic workshops. I am always eager to explore new QA tools, advance my research, 
      and contribute to building reliable, sustainable, and user-friendly software systems.
